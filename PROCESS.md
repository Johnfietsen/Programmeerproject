## Week 2
### Monday
Done:
* JSON file for network completed.

Not done but planned:
* First network visualization.
* JSON for map.

Problems encountered:
* Correctly placing the lists of possible connections in the JSON file.

Decisions:
* Instead of a separate JSON file for every iteration (which is not feasible in hindsight), I shall make a JSON for every algorithm. It is made of a dict with four lists (one for every algorithm, with every element in the list representing an iteration).
* First the network and map will be made, then the stacked area chart and the last thing will be the sunburst.

Comments:
Today was not a productive day. I also have the feeling that I'm falling behind compared to other people because of my struggle with the JSON files for the visualizations.
