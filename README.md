# Amstelhaege algorithms


## Problem statement

When testing algorithms to solve the case of Amstelhaege, it can be difficult to interpret the results based on maps alone. The addition of a line graph with the score and an animation of the movement of houses can give some insight in the process of the algorithms, but do not properly show the underlying principles that ultimately determine the score achieved. What is missing are visualisations that show the relation between the houses and the distribution of freespace over the houses. This does not only enchance the understanding of the Amstelhaege case, but makes it easier to reinterpret the results for other cases that evolve around the positioning of objects in the Euclidian space.


## Solution

**This visualisation solves the lack of information by visualising the houses on the map as a network and the distribution of freespace as a piechart**
